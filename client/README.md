# Kinesis Frontend

This is a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) frontend for the Kinesis StuyHacks XI project.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start the development server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies`.
