		Kinesis is a novel method of managing covid contact tracing, written for <a
			href="https://stuyhacks-xi.devpost.com/"><i>StuyHacks XI</i></a
		>. Instead of guessing where people are based on involuntary geolocation
		and wireless info, this app uses voluntary (but safe) information.
		Rather than force people into being silently tracked, we offer them the
		service and certainty of contact tracing combined with the convenience
		of seating arrangements and reservations. We use industry standard
		software libraries to provide consistent and reliable service, such as
		e-mail notifcatications to potentially exposed indivudiduals.
